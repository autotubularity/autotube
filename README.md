# AutoTube

AutoTube quantifies vascular parameters such as the vessel area, width, skeleton length or the number of branching points 
of vascular networks in tissues or in in vitro assays. AutoTube is freely available, comprises an intuitive Graphical 
User Interface (GUI) and helps to perform otherwise highly time-consuming image analyses in a rapid, automated objective 
and reproducible manner.

This repository contains the source files needed to run AutoTube and also a manual to understand AutoTube's functionality.
