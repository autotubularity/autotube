# AutoTube

AutoTube quantifies vascular parameters such as the vessel area, width, skeleton length or the number of branching points 
of vascular networks in tissues or in in vitro assays. AutoTube is freely available, comprises an intuitive Graphical 
User Interface (GUI) and helps to perform otherwise highly time-consuming image analyses in a rapid, automated objective 
and reproducible manner.

This repository contains the source files needed to run AutoTube and also a manual to understand AutoTube's functionality.

If you use AutoTube, we appreciate it if you cite an appropriate subset of the following papers:

1. Installation.

 - This code is written for the Matlab interpreter (tested with versions R2017a) and requires the Matlab Image Processing Toolbox. 

 - To use AutoTube follow the instructions described in https://github.com/autotubularity/autotube/wiki

 - Finally, optionally download the Lymphatic Vessel dataset (used in the paper):
 https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000262426
 After downloading the dataset, you can run AutoTube with the same parameters described in the paper. You should obtain the same statistics.
